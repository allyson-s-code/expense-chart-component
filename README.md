## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Chart.js

### What I learned

This was my first time using chart.js and it was a lot of fun. Chart.js has lots of documentation and videos and I found the videos very helpful.

### Continued development

I will continue working with data dynamically and my JavaScript skills.

### Useful resources

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - So so helpful. Lots of documentation.
